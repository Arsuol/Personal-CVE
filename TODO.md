# TODO
This files presents the possible futur developments for this tool

## Data and Statistics
Use the Panda library to incorporate more statistics and data analysis.

## Social Networks
Look for more information sources: Podcasts for example.  

## Multithreading
Some analysis are reading multiple files in a row.  
Use threads to distribute the load.

## UI Solution
The current solution uses the terminal to display text data.  
A (local) webserver could be used to:  
  - diplay text data, as well a graphs, and other data formats.  
  - Ease the use of redirect links.  
  - Intuitive data accessicibility and browsing.
