# Personal-CVE
The Personal-CVE tool downloads CVSS files from https://nvd.nist.gov/
and stores them for offline search, consultation, and reference.  

Downloading the full CVSS database limits lookups to online CVE databases and 
earns (a lot of) time in the long run.

## Usage
Lauch the personalcve script to start using the tool:
```
python3 ./bin/personalcve.py
```
The tool will print out the help information.
